## Stack :

Front-end : React js, Next js , tailwind css
Back-end: Node js , Express js
Database: Postgres
Caching: Redis
API: Restful
Deployment: AWS
Payment gateway: Stripe
Messaging service: Twillio
Analytics: Google Analytics
CDN: Cloudflare

## Project structure :

For this stack we will be using a monolothic repository to simplify the structure and keep the whole application in one spot.
To be more specifc we will using Turborepo which provide many features to help manage multipe application in one repo, it helps with mananging code dependencies,provides "Incremental builds" as the project grouws building the application takes a long time turborepo cache what was built before if it didn't change it will not require to biuld it again, it can also do parralel execution which means it can build the front-end and the back-end side of the applcation in the same time.I can even generate build profiles and import them to the browser to understand which tasks are taking the longest time to run.


### Apps and Packages

- `client`: a Next js app
- `server`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
